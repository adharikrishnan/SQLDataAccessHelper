## Overview

A Helper Library for  SQL Server and PostgreSQL to help streamline database interactions, suitable for database-first architectures.

- SQL Connection, Commands and Data Reader Lifetimes are fully managed by the library classes.
- Consumers only need to worry about passing in the correct SQL Commands, Command Type and Parameters.
- Supports standard Reader, Scalar and Non Query Operations for both SQL Server and PostgreSQL, with both Synchronous and Asynchronous methods for the three.
- Supports opening both standard connections with both read and write operations, and readonly connections with only readonly connections 

## Example

```csharp
using SqlDataAccessHelper.Core.SQLServer;

SqlServerDataAccess dataAccess = new SqlServerDataAccess("Your Connection String");

using (dataAccess.Open())
{
    var dataReader = dataAccess.ExecuteReader(CommandType.Text, "Your Query", yourParameters);
    
    if(dataReader.HasRows)
    {
        while(dataReader.Read())
        {
            // Read thae data as required
        }
    }
    // If another reader is open for the same connection, the class instance will automatically close 
    // and dispose of the previous.
    var dataReader2 = dataAccess.ExecuteReader(CommandType.StoredProcedure, "Your Query", yourParameters);
}
// Any open readers and commands are disposed along with the connection.
```
